# Sales-python-Data-Science-Tasks

Set of real world data science tasks completed using the Python Pandas library.


# Environment Setup

To replicate and run the Sales Analysis project, the following tools and libraries are required:

Tools:
Python 3.8+: The project is written in Python, so make sure you have Python installed. 
Jupyter Notebook: A great environment for running and presenting data analysis projects. 

# Libraries:

Install the following libraries using pip:

terminal :pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

Pandas: For handling and manipulating the sales dataset.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib: For plotting graphs to visualize sales trends.
Seaborn: To generate advanced visualizations.
Scikit-learn: For any machine learning models you may include.

# Dataset:
Make sure the sales dataset is available in your working directory. The dataset should include fields like Order ID, Product, Quantity Ordered, Price Each, Order Date, and Purchase Address.

# Steps to Run:
1.Clone the project repository or download the project files.
2.Open Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the project directory.
3.Run the individual cells to generate analysis and visualizations.
